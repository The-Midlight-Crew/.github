### Welcome. We are The Midlight Crew. We're a bunch of teenagers who (ethically) hack, make, and design things to make our lives better.

### In other words, we're a bunch of goofy little nerds.

## Our beliefs:

- Code is art that actually does something.
- You own yourself and the right to do whatever you want, so long as you do not take that right away for others.
- Raven Development Team sucks.
- Open Source, all the way.
- Make things as cursed as they can be, for no reason (e.g. coding full apps in Scratch :D)
- Screw schools, learn in your own way.
